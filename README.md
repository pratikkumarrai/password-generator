# 1. Introduction

This is a Python-based GUI application that generates secure and customizable passwords using the Tkinter library. The application provides users with flexibility to choose the password length and character types (letters, digits, special characters) through an interactive and user-friendly interface

# 2. Main Objective

To develop a lightweight desktop application that helps users generate strong, random passwords based on customizable criteria to enhance their digital security

# 3. Software Objective

•	Design a password generator that is simple, intuitive, and secure.

•	Provide an interactive graphical interface using Python's Tkinter library.

•	Ensure cross-platform compatibility without the need for internet access.

 # 4. System Design
The application follows a modular design:

•	Frontend: GUI created using Tkinter.

•	Backend: Core logic for password generation using Python libraries like string and random.

•	Clipboard Integration: Allows copying the generated password for immediate use.

  # 5. Functionalities Implemented

•	Input field to specify password length.

•	Checkboxes to include:

o	Letters (uppercase and lowercase)

o	Digits (0–9)

o	Special Characters (!@#...)

•	Generate button to create a password.

•	Display box to show the password.

•	Copy to clipboard functionality with confirmation popup.

•	Input validation and warning messages.

# 6. Workflow

1.	Launch the application.

2.	Enter desired password length.

3.	Select character types via checkboxes.

4.	Click Generate Password to display a new password.

5.	Optionally, click Copy to Clipboard to use the password elsewhere.

6.	If no options are selected or invalid input is provided, a warning message appears.

 # 7. Sample Input/Output

Input:

•	Password Length: 5

•	Selected: ✅ Letters, ✅ Digits, ❌ Special Characters

  # 8. Advantages

•	Simple and intuitive interface for all users.

•	Generates strong and secure passwords.

•	Cross-platform compatibility.

•	No internet required – fully offline.

•	Instant copy feature for ease of use.

  # 9. Limitations

•	No option to exclude similar-looking characters (e.g., O and 0, l and 1).

•	No password history or storage.

•	No password strength meter.

•	Cannot save or export passwords to a file.

  # 10. Future Enhancements

•	Add password strength indicator (Weak, Medium, Strong).

•	Implement a dark mode toggle.

•	Option to avoid ambiguous characters.

•	Save generated passwords to a secure encrypted file.

•	Add animation or sound effects for better UX.

# 11. Conclusion
This Password Generator provides an efficient and user-friendly way to create secure passwords based on user-defined preferences. It is an ideal tool for individuals seeking quick and customizable password generation through a simple graphical interface built using Python and Tkinter.
